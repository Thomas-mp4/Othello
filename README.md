# Othello

A C# implementation of the classic board game **Othello** (also known as Reversi). This project is part of my learning of C#, with a focus on MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller), TDD (Test-Driven Development) and software design principles.

## Game Rules

[Othello](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english) is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board. Each player takes turns placing their colored pieces (Black or White) on the board. The objective is to have the majority of your color on the board at the end of the game. Players capture their opponent's pieces by "capturing" them between two of their own pieces.
